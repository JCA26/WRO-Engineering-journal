Project Title
Autonomous LEGO-Based Car for Lap Completion

Season
WRO 2025

Project Description
Our project focuses on developing and programming an autonomous LEGO car that completes laps around a closed-loop track as quickly and accurately as possible. The robot is fully autonomous after start, prioritizing speed and control to avoid penalties from obstacle collisions. The car uses a combination of **color sensors**, **ultrasonic sensors**, and a **LEGO Spike Prime system** to detect its position, avoid collisions, and steer effectively through the course.
